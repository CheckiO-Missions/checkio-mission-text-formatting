<!-- Describe task in general -->
<p>
	You are given a long line (monospace font), and you have to break the line in order to respect a given width.
	Then you have to format the text thanks to the given style: 'l' means you have to put the text on the <strong>l</strong>eft, 'c' for <strong>c</strong>enter, 'r' for <strong>r</strong>ight, and 'j' means you have to <strong>j</strong>ustify the text.
	Finally, each line of the output should not end with any whitespace.
</p>

<p>
	If you have 2 * n + 1 spaces to put around a line in order to center it, then put n spaces before, not n + 1.
</p>

<p>
	Justify rules:
	<ul>
		<li>Since we can't always put the same number of spaces between words in a line, put big blocks of spaces first. For example: X---X---X--X--X--X when you have to put 12 spaces in 5 gaps: 3-3-2-2-2.</li>
		<li>Don't justify the last line of a text.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>
	You won't have to consider to break a word in two parts because given widths are big enough.
</p>


<!-- Explain input and output values -->
<p>
	<strong>Input:</strong>
	A text (string), a width (integer) and a style (string).
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Output:</strong>
	The formatted text (string).
